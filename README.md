Tiny package containing useful parameters from main galaxy surveys (with units).

The goal of this project is to provide a Python library with minimal dependencies that centralises galaxy survey properties with adequate reference. Such information tends to be scattered in many places or is often copy/pasted without all of the relevant information like units or sources.

**WORK IN PROGRESS: the API is still unstable, expect backward incompatibilities**

Getting started
---------------
1.  Install the latest version of the library
    ```sh
    pip install -U galcheat
    ```
2. Run the demo = print the available surveys and associated filters
    ```sh
    python -m galcheat
    # or
    galcheat
    ```

API
---
```python
# The list of available surveys
from galcheat import available_surveys

# Getter methods to retrieve a Survey of a Filter dataclass
from galcheat import get_survey, get_filter

Rubin = get_survey("Rubin")
u_band = get_filter("u", "Rubin")
# which is a proxy for
u_band = Rubin.get_filter("u")

# Get the list of available filters
Rubin.available_filters

# or as a dictionary with all `Filter` objects
Rubin.get_filters()

# Both Survey and Filter classes have physical attributes
Rubin.mirror_diameter
u_band.exposure_time

# Filters are also attributes of a Survey
Rubin.filters.u.exposure_time  # same attribute as above

# These attributes are Astropy Quantity objects with units
fwhm = u_band.psf_fwhm
# The value in the original units is obtained as
fwhm.value
# or it can be converted to other units
import astropy.units as u
fwhm.to_value(u.arcmin)
```

Contributing
------------
A number is missing? An error slipped into the files? A survey is not included in the list and you can provide the relevant information or some of it?

Head over to the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn how to participate into making this library more robust and complete.

The current parameters and the corresponding units are specified in the [data README](galcheat/data/README.md).

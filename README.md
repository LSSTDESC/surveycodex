Tiny package containing useful parameters from main galaxy surveys (with units).

The goal of this project is to provide a Python library with minimal dependencies that centralises galaxy survey properties with adequate reference. Such information tends to be scattered in many places or is often copy/pasted without all of the relevant information like units or sources.

Getting started
---------------
1.  Install the latest version of the library
    ```sh
    pip install -U galcheat
    ```
2. Run the demo = print the available surveys and associated filters
    ```sh
    python -m galcheat
    # or
    galcheat
    ```

API
---
```python
from galcheat import survey_info

# Available surveys
print(list(survey_info.keys()))

# Rubin U band PSF FWHM
Rubin = survey_info["Rubin"]
fwhm = Rubin.filters.u.psf_fwhm  # Quantity object with units
print(fwhm)

# Retrieve the value in the original units
print(fwhm.value)

# Or convert to other units
import astropy.units as u
print(fwhm.to_value(u.arcmin))
```

Contributing
------------
A number is missing? An error slipped into the files? A survey is not included in the list and you can provide the relevant information or some of it?

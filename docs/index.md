# Welcome to `galcheat`

`galcheat` is a tiny package containing useful parameters from main galaxy surveys (**with units**).

The goal of this project is to provide a Python library with minimal dependencies that centralises galaxy survey properties with adequate reference. Such information tends to be scattered in many places or is often copy/pasted without all of the relevant information like units or sources.

## Commands

```
python -m galcheat
```

## Installation

```sh
python -m pip install -U galcheat
```

## Optional installation

### Scripts

To be able to run the Python scripts in the `script` folder, use the extra install

```sh
python -m pip install -U galcheat[scripts]
```

### Developers

The developer tools needed to perform tests and linting can be installed with

```sh
python -m pip install -U galcheat[dev]
```

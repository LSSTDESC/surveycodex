# Notes
# -----
# The reference link for sky_brightness for Suprime-Cam, should be approximately okay.
# Here is the updated version for HSC as of July 2021
# https://www.subarutelescope.org/Observing/Instruments/HSC/hsc_etc_report.html.
# We could update the numbers to this version, although we need to
# convert the unit from ADU/sec to mag/arcsec^2.
